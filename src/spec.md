# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the app’s visual styling to a cohesive electric/technology (neon-tech) color palette while keeping the current layout and all text and UI structure unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply an electric/tech palette (dark base with neon accents such as cyan/teal/magenta) consistently across the page background, text, and UI surfaces.
- Update headline styling colors while keeping the exact headline text “Bytes console winning!” and its per-line emphasis unchanged.
- Adjust the code entry input’s border, focus ring, and related states to use the new neon accent color(s) with sufficient contrast and accessibility.
- Ensure no user-facing copy changes occur; only color/styling updates are made.

**User-visible outcome:** The app looks “electric/tech” themed with neon accents throughout, while the headline text and code-entry UI behave and read exactly the same as before.
