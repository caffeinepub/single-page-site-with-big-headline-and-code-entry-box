# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a single-page view with a very large headline reading “Bytes console winning!” and a code entry input beneath it, styled with a minimal console/bytes theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a centered, visually dominant headline displaying the exact text: "Bytes console winning!"
- Add a labeled/placeholder text input directly beneath the headline for entering a code, with local state updates on typing
- Apply a consistent, intentional “console/bytes” visual theme (typography, spacing, background, colors) that avoids a blue/purple primary look

**User-visible outcome:** On load, users see the large “Bytes console winning!” headline and can type into a clearly labeled code input on a clean, centered, themed single-page layout.
