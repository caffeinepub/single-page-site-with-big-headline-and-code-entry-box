        "The page uses a cohesive electric/tech palette (e.g., dark base with bright neon accents such as cyan/teal/magenta) applied consistently across background, text, borders, and focus states.",
        "The headline still displays the exact text “Bytes console winning!” with distinct emphasis per line, but with updated electric/tech colors (e.g., primary and accent feel neon/tech).",
        "The code input’s border and focus ring clearly reflect the updated electric/tech accent color(s) and remain accessible with sufficient contrast against the background.",
        "No changes are made to user-facing copy (e.g., “Enter Code”, placeholder text, footer text) other than color/styling."
