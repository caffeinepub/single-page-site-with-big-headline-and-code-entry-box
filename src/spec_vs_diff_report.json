  "summary": "Frontend single-page view and code input were added with a console-like Tailwind theme, but the headline does not match the exact required text string and several non-goal/constraint-violating additions were introduced (authentication hooks/provider, backend file, and extra UI/footer).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Display the exact text \"Bytes console winning!\" in very large, prominent letters at the top/center of the page.",
      "reason": "The headline is split across multiple spans/lines (\"Bytes\" / \"console\" / \"winning!\") rather than rendering the exact single string \"Bytes console winning!\" as written, and the layout centers the headline vertically rather than placing it at the top/center.",

    {
      "description": "Added/used Internet Identity authentication context and actor hooks (authentication-related code and provider wrapping the app).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists \"No authentication (Internet Identity)\" as a non-goal and also constrains changes to those hook files; diff introduces these files/usages anyway.",

    {
      "description": "Backend canister file added (empty actor).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest states backend changes are not required and requests not to add unnecessary backend features.",
